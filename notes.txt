What is Exception Handling : 

It is a mechanism of handling the runtime errors during execution of the program. 

In SpringBoot, we can implement exception handling by using 

@ExceptionHandler annotation

@ControllerAdvice annotation

Employ(EmpId,Empname,Salary,SalDate,Dept,MgrId)

E1,Srinath,84834,'Aug-2024','Java',1
E1,Srinath,83844,'Sep-2024','Java'1

We need the help of composite key. as making EmpID+SalDate as 
composite primary key

Then EmpId can exist multiple times, Saldate exists multiple times

but combination not to be repeated. 

Why we prefer MVC ???

In Traditional web applications, we have 3 layers as

UI Business Layer and Data Layer : All these 3 layers are connected in serial format.

Changes in one layer will have huge impact on another layer. 

This problem we need to overcome as 

I want to make my application as loosely coupled and tightly integrated, then we need the help of MVC. 

MVC can be done w.r.t. TDD env (Test Driven Development) 

Model -> Business Logic (whatever business logic we need to do then we need write in Model)

View  -> Contains all the UI related code, input pages, error message pages, notification pages

Controller -> Acts as a glue between model and view.  Based on action path, you need to redirect to any page, that would be specified by using controller. 

JdbcTemplate : Performs jdbc operations.

Spring Security : is a framework that which provides various features like authentication, authorization to create a securre spring enterprise application. 

Because, here we need to protect pages or urls from directly accessing. 

Authentication : It is a process of giving permission to access resource after providing valid credentials...

Authorization  : It is a process in which the authenticated user has permission to access the particular resource portion. 



Authentication is process of knowing and identifying the user that wants to access, authorization is process to allow authority to perform actions in the application. 


Spring Framework will provide various levels of authentication modes known as 

	-> Http Basic AUthentication

	-> XML based authentication

	-> Java Based Authentication

	-> Form Based Authentication
